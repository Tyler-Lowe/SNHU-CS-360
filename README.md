Weight Tracking App
Overview
This mobile app was developed as part of CS 360. It allows users to track their daily weight, set weight goals, and view their progress over time. The project demonstrates the use of Android Studio, SQLite databases, and user-centered design principles.

App Summary
The goal of this app was to create a simple, user-friendly tool for tracking daily weight and setting goals. The app helps users monitor their weight over time and provides reminders when they reach or approach their goal weight. This app was designed to address the needs of users who want an easy way to log their weight daily and see their progress.

UI Design and Features
The app features several key screens:

Login Screen: Allows users to create a login or log in if they already have an account.
Weight Entry Screen: Lets users input their daily weight.
Goal Weight Screen: Users can set a goal weight.
Weight History Screen: Displays a history of the user's weight entries in a simple list.
SMS Notification: Reminds users about their progress if they give permission for SMS.
The UI design focused on simplicity and ease of use. Each screen was designed with the user in mind, ensuring that the layout was clean, intuitive, and responsive on different device sizes.

Coding Process
The app's development followed a structured approach. I first created the UI using XML layouts and ensured that the design met user needs. Then, I built the functionality using Java and SQLite to handle data storage. I focused on breaking down the project into manageable pieces, creating and testing one feature at a time before moving on to the next.

In the future, I could apply this technique to any project by prioritizing small tasks and testing frequently to catch errors early.

Testing
I tested the app frequently throughout development using the Android Emulator. This process was important to make sure that each feature worked as expected and that the app was stable. I also checked for compatibility across different Android versions. Testing revealed a few bugs, such as database handling issues, which I resolved by refining my code structure.

Challenges and Innovations
One challenge I faced was managing the database efficiently. I had to think about how to structure the data to store user weights and goals. To overcome this, I learned more about how SQLite works and applied that knowledge to create a reliable and efficient database.

Successes
I was particularly successful in implementing the SQLite database. The app's ability to save user data, display it in a list, and allow users to set goals demonstrates my skills in handling data storage and user interaction. The SMS notification feature also shows how I can implement more advanced functionality, such as user alerts.
